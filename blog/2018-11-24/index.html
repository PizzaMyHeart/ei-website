<h1 id="no-changes-to-data-sharing-as-streams-absorbed-by-google">No changes to data sharing as Streams absorbed by Google</h1>

<p>A spokesperson from Royal Free along with Dr Dominic King, Medical Director at Google DeepMind, have given assurances that no changes to data sharing will occur as a result of the move of the Streams team to Google. As per King, “At this stage our contracts have not moved to Google and nothing has changed in terms of where the data we process is stored. The same applies to the data that we process under these contracts. All decisions about how patient data is processed will continue to lie with our partners, including our four NHS Streams partnerships.”</p>

<p>ExcelScope2.0 is a device that uses a smartphone to capture multiple views of a blood sample and determines the number of malaria parasites present using an algorithm. As per James Dyson, “Excelscope is the epitome of sustainable design. It takes widely available materials, and turns them into a potentially life-saving device. Such progressive thinking is exactly what I’m looking for.”</p>

<p>The system, called DBLG1, receives continuous blood glucose readings from a monitor and uses predictive analytics to optimise the function of an insulin pump.</p>

<h1 id="gp-at-hand-passes-nhs-england-safety-assessment">GP At Hand passes NHS England safety assessment</h1>

<p>GP At Hand, a remote GP service operated by Babylon Health via a Fulham-based GP practice, has passed a safety assessment leading to the opening of the service to all patients. Previously, patients with complex conditions were barred from registering with the service. The published CCG board papers do state, however, that “sometimes it may not be clinically appropriate for patients to register with a practice that is not local to their home.”</p>
