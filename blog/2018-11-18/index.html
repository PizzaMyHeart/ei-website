<p>DeepMind has announced that the team behind their patient tracking application Streams, notably trialled at the Royal Free hospital to detect AKIs, has been moved over to Google. The aim seems to be scaling the technology behind Streams to facilitate Google’s healthcare pursuits on a larger scale.</p>

<h1 id="ucl-trusts-to-trial-respiratory-rate-monitoring-device">UCL trusts to trial respiratory rate monitoring device</h1>

<p>UCLH, Royal Free and Whittington trusts along with Basildon and Thurrington Hospitals are set to trial a new device for the monitoring of patients’ respiratory rate. Following an 8-week set-up phase, selected trusts will undergo a full 6-month trial of the device created by NHS Innovation Accelerator start-up RespiraSense. The device works by measuring the displacement between the ribs and the abdomen.</p>

<p>Diagnostic technology company IQuity (pronounced I-Q-witty) has recently received a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to build a platform around the early detection of Alzheimer’s. The CEO talks about how their disease knowledge and data science expertise can be combined to allow early disease detection and patient monitoring</p>

<h1 id="nhs-digital-confirms-end-of-patient-data-sharing-with-home-office">NHS Digital confirms end of patient data sharing with Home Office</h1>

<p>NHS Digital has confirmed it has stopped a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which saw the organisation sharing non-clinical information with the Home Office. The memoradum, which came into effect in January 2017, allowed the Home Office to gain access to patient data – including non-clinical information – for the purpose of tracing immigration offenders and vulnerable people. The revised version of the agreement is anticipated to better protect people’s rights to privacy and the access to healthcare.</p>
