<p>The committee has been hard at work planning events and improvements for the academic year, and we are glad to be sharing some of those with you today!</p>

<p>In the first term, our events will revolve around firstly showcasing successful startups and having their founders to come share their journeys, offering advice to anyone thinking about entrepreneurship in the medical field. Secondly, we&rsquo;ll be thinking about medical apps - what exactly is their use, what kind of apps have found success and how can one go about creating their own app to cover a use case they&rsquo;re passionate about? Stay tuned for more news!</p>

<p>We will also be launching our own website in the coming weeks! We have plans to upload all kinds of content from guest articles and interviews to post-event reports and guides pointing you to high-quality resources for learning about things like programming. You guys will also be able to have a say about what kind of content you find most interesting and want to see more of.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be kicking off today with our first weekly medical E&amp;I news recap on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/uclei">FB page</a>, so keep your eyes peeled for that!</p>
