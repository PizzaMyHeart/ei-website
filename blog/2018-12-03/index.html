<h1 id="new-national-locator-service-links-paramedics-to-shared-care-record">New National Locator Service links paramedics to shared care record</h1>

<p>NHS Digital has launched a new service allowing emergency medical personnel to access shared care records when called to a mental health patient in distress. By sharing patient’s crisis plan. it aims to allow paramedics to direct patients to more appropriate care setting as community-based care may be more suitable than A&amp;E for some patients.</p>

<h1 id="vitality-s-apple-watch-initiative-leads-to-sustained-physical-activity-increase">Vitality’s Apple Watch initiative leads to sustained physical activity increase</h1>

<p>A large-scale study of an Apple watch incentive programme from insurerer Vitality, coverying 400,000 people has recorded sustained 34% increase in physical activity. The study has shown the effectiveness of wearable tech, linked to a goal-orientated incentive and behavioural change programmes when promoting an increase in physical activity.</p>

<h1 id="new-e-skin-nearly-as-sensitive-as-real-one">New E-skin Nearly as Sensitive as Real One</h1>

<p>Researchers from Stanford University have created an electronic skin that can measure slight pressures and even the direction in which they are applied, which gives enough information to robotic fingers to manipulate soft and squishy objects without damaging them. Although this is intended for robotic hands, the technology may give powered prostheses similar capabilities.</p>

<h1 id="new-male-contraceptive-gel-under-development">New male contraceptive gel under development</h1>

<p>National Institute of Health (NIH) is to fund a clinical trial to evaluate a new contraceptive technology for men to shoulder some more responsibility for birth control and to reduce unwanted pregnancies. The NES/T gel is put on a man’s back and shoulders, where it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. It contains segesterone, which blocks testes from producing testosterone, which will reduce sperm production to low to nonexistent levels.</p>
